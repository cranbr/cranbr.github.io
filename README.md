## intro
Hello! My name is Cranbr. I am a software developer, digital artist, music producer, and cat owner (my full time job). I've started this account to create a clean break from my other work, and to allow myself anonymity when releasing personal projectsâ€”namely video games! In the past, I have struggled to make consistent progress on game development, so my goal with this project is to develop a regular schedule for releasing small, probably crappy, games. I have a full time job and other life obligations, so I am still waffling about the best timeframe, but am leaning towards either weekly, biweekly, or monthly. In addition to the games themselves, I'll be releasing dev logs detailing the tehcnical process, thought process, and what I learned. Above all else, my goal is just to make people happy with video games.

Thanks for reading!
